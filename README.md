# Ian Phillips' Portfolio
## Welcome to My Portfolio!
In this portfolio, you will find a collection of REST APIs developed using Python in VSCode. Each of these APIs is utilized for initiatives delivered to stakeholders, demonstrating their practical application.

Please note that I prioritize thorough documentation in all my projects to ensure clarity and transparency. For the purpose of this portfolio, I have removed documentation to provide a clear and concise view of my work.

Azure DevOps REST API: here<br>

I built and utilized this API to support two different initiatives.

Automated and standardized reporting processes from Product Owners and Product Area Owners to C-Suite Executives. Data extracted via the REST API was cleansed of HTML tags and integrated into Power BI. All reports were automatically stored in SharePoint and distributed via email weekly.<br>

Delivered automated project planning reports that enabled strategic prioritization based on business value and complexity. All data was fed into a Power BI report to give a holistic view of IT initiatives and their dependencies.<br>

Tableau REST API: here<br>

The Tableau REST API was used to automate QA before weekly meetings with Amazon (Amazon LMD), ensuring no revenue loss.<br>

Office 365 API: here <br>

Utilized to pull data from various SharePoint lists and other files. Data pulled was run through Python workflows and then fed into Power BI for reporting.<br>

Linking my Python to SharePoint was highly beneficial! It allowed me to perform all data preparation in Python and feed it to reports rather than doing it in Excel or Power Query Editor.<br>

Power BI Refresh History API: here <br>

This API is straightforward. It pulls refresh data from the Power BI server to provide a 100% accurate refresh time at the top of my reports. My previous approach was using average refresh duration plus scheduled refresh time.<br>

Overall, this was a small efficiency win that I was able to use and share with others at Bridgestone!<br>

Dynatrace Applications API: here <br>

The Dynatrace API was used to query data from Dynatrace, allowing me to perform data preparation on the backend, avoiding Power Query Editor. This ultimately sped up user-facing reports and refresh times.<br>
