# Ian Phillips  Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio!

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of REST APIs developed using Python in VSCode. Each of these APIs are utilized for initiatives delivered to stakeholders, demonstrating their practical application.

Please note that I prioritize thorough documentation in all my projects to ensure clarity and transparency. For the purpose of this portfolio, I have removed documentation to provide a clear and concise view of my work.



Azure Dev Ops REST API:[here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/azuredevops_github_cleaned.py)<br>

I built and utilized this API to feed into 2 different initiatives.

1. Automated and standardized reporting processes from Product Owners and Product Area Owners to C-Suite Executives. Data extracted via the REST API was cleansed of HTML tags and integrated into Power BI. All reports were automatically stored in SharePoint and distributed via email weekly.<br>
<br>
2.  Delivered automated project planning reports that enabled strategic prioritization based on business value and complexity. All of the data of was fed into a Power BI report to give a wholistic view of IT Intiatives and their dependencies.<br>

Tableau REST API: [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/tableau_rest_api_github_cleaned.py)<br>

The Tableau REST API was used to automate QA before the weekly meetings with Amazon (Amazon LMD) ensuring no revenue loss.<br>
