# Ian Phillips  Portfolio

## Welcome to my portfolio!

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of REST APIs developed using Python in VSCode. Each of these APIs are utilized for initiatives delivered to stakeholders, demonstrating their practical application.

Please note that I prioritize thorough documentation in all my projects to ensure clarity and transparency. For the purpose of this portfolio, I have removed documentation to provide a clear and concise view of my work.
