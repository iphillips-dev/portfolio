# Ian Phillips  Portfolio

## Welcome to My Portfolio

In this portfolio, you will find a collection of REST APIs developed using Python in VSCode. Each of these APIs are utilized for initiatives delivered to stakeholders, demonstrating their practical application.

Please note that I prioritize thorough documentation in all my projects to ensure clarity and transparency. For the purpose of this portfolio, I have removed documentation to provide a clear and concise view of my work.



***Azure Dev Ops REST API:***  [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/azuredevops_github_cleaned.py)<br>

I built and utilized this API to feed into 2 different initiatives.

1. Automated and standardized reporting processes from Product Owners and Product Area Owners to C-Suite Executives. Data extracted via the REST API was cleansed of HTML tags and integrated into Power BI. All reports were automatically stored in SharePoint and distributed via email weekly.<br>

2. Delivered automated project planning reports that enabled strategic prioritization based on business value and complexity. All of the data of was fed into a Power BI report to give a wholistic view of IT Intiatives and their dependencies.<br>

***Tableau REST API:***  [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/tableau_rest_api_github_cleaned.py)<br>

The Tableau REST API was used to automate QA before the weekly meetings with Amazon (Amazon LMD) ensuring no revenue loss.<br>

***Office 365 API:***  [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/office365_sharepoint_api_github_cleaned.py) <br>

Utilized to pull data from various SharePoint lists and other files. Data pulled was ran through python workflows then fed into Power BI for reporting. <br>

Linking my python to sharepoint was super beneficial! It allowed me to do all data prep in python the feed it to reports rather than doing it in Excel or Power Query Editor. <br>

***Power BI Refresh History API:***  [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/powerbi_refresh_history_api_github_cleaned.py) <br>

 This one is short and sweet. It pulls refresh data from Power BI server to provide a 100% accurate refresh time at the top of my reports. My old way of doing this was average refresh duration + scheduled refresh time.<br>

 Overall this was a small efficientcy win that I was able to use and share with others at Bridgestone! <br>

 ***Dynatrace Applications API:***  [here](https://github.com/iphillips-dev/portfolio/blob/main/dynatrace_applications_api_github_cleaned.py) <br>

 The Dynatrace API was used to query data from Dynatrace allowing me to do data prep on the backend avoiding Power Query Editor. This ultimately speeds up user-facigng reports and refresh times. <br>
